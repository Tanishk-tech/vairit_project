                        By his youth, Lala Ji had developed close bonds with the

                        spice was in high demand in mainland India, Lala Ji soon
                        began procuring Hing from the Pashtuns and trading it with
                        Hindus in mainland India. This would mark the beginning of

                    focused primarily on the Hindi heartland of India's north. Shri Ajay Bhatia was surprised to
                    find that south India was, in fact, a bigger market. Hing is widely used in Sambar, a staple
                    dish of the south and is thus consumed extensively. Seizing the opportunity, Shri Ajay
                    Bhatia developed a strong customer base in the region. The 1990s saw the company
                    supplying raw Hing to manufacturers across the southern cities from Hyderabad to Chennai
